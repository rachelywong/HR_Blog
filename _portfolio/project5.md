In this episode of GitHub Basics, we begin our journey in learning the ins and outs of GitHub Etiquette. I was inspired to start this series after working with a “professional” data scientist who didn’t know how to use GitHub branches.

## GitHub Etiquette

> "The test of good manners is to be able to put up pleasantly with bad ones." - Wendell Willkie

GitHub etiquette plays such a large role when you’re working with a team. As I write this, flashbacks of my teammates overwriting the entire main branch or breaking/deleting our code and being unable to handle all the merge conflicts, keep flying through my head. I’ve come up with a basic workflow for collaborative GitHub projects so we can minimize these disasters. 

**Step 1. Use branches**

I have gone through the great debate of forks vs. branches. What’s the difference? A fork makes a full copy of the entire repository and you can continue working on the project on your own without touching the main repository. Branches add a copy of the repository (depending on which branch you branch from) at that place and time. You can then add your changes to that branch and merge it back in with the branch we branched from. Pros and cons? Forks are great to have your own copy of the entire repository, if you want the freedom to mess around with all the workings of the code. But IMO, it makes more sense to have branches for either each person or each task. Branches let each person work on their portion of the project, and changes can be easily identified and reverted when we use branches.

With branches, we can easily see the commit history between HD and RW and the different merges into master. Forks are similar, but I find branches are much easier to divide up work.

**Step 2. Branch protection**

Branch protection is the Apple insurance you don’t want to to pay for but know you need the security. Set it up for your main/master branch to avoid any accidental pull requests!

**Step 3. Make good commit messages**
